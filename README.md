# AnalyticalDataCSVs

For plots: All CSV files pertaining to each sensitivity study are under the files titled "Compare" as well as the Jupyter Notebook used to generate all those plots.

For generating CSV files used in plots: All jupyter notebooks and required input CSV files are under the files titled "RunSensitivityStudies", these will generate the CSV files used in each sensitivity study plot

NOTE: Make sure to read the notes left in the jupyter notebooks for running the sensitivity studies, the files titled "RunSensitivityStudies". These notes are critical to run the sensitivity studies correctly. Also make sure FrictionFactors.ipynb notebook is in the same folder as all "RunSensitivityStudies" jupyter notebooks in order to get all the functions needed to calculate pressure drop and flow distribution. 

IMPORTING Error: If the FrictionFactors.ipynb jupyter notebook won't import correctly, type the following command into the terminal: "pip3 install ipynb"
